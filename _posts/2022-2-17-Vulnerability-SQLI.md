## 📚 What is **SQLI** ?

(**SQLi**) attack exploits the **injection of SQL commands** into the **SQL queries** of a web application.

A successful **SQLi** attack lets **malicious hackers** **access** and **manipulate** a web
application's backend **database**.

To interact with **databases**, entities such as **systems operators**, **programmers**, **applications**, and **web applications** use the Structured Query Language (**SQL**).

**SQL Like:**

**SQL** is a powerful interpreted language used to **extract and manipulate data from a database.**

---

## 🤔 Why SQLI happen ?

A web developer **trust** in **users** and **missing** to put any **input validation** or **output encoding** to prevent user from interacting with database queries

**Modern web frameworks** now days solved this problem with **predefined functions** that defend against sqli like **laravel** framework based on **php**

**Example:**

$id Parameter is vulnerable to sqli 

![](https://i.imgur.com/xosrZuD.png)

```ruby
' UNION SELECT Username, Password FROM Accounts WHERE 'a'='a
```
try to provide id paramter with values payload above to achieve your sqli attack

## 🔎 Finding SQL Injection

The most straightforward way to find SQL injections within a web application is to probe its inputs with **characters that are known to cause the SQL query to be syntactically invalid** and thus forcing the web application to **return** an **error**.

Input parameters are carried through **GET** and **POST** requests,**HEADERS** and **COOKIES**. So, we have to check all the channels where data is retrieved from the client.

---

## 🌀 What are types of **SQLI** ?

![](https://i.imgur.com/4caA7ow.png)

**-In-band SQL injections**

leverage the **same channel** used to inject the SQL code (i.e., the pages generated by the web application).

**- Error-Based SQL injection attack:**

The penetration tester tries to force the **DMBS** to **output an error message** and then uses that information to perform data exfiltration.

**- Union-Based SQL injection attack:**

The ability of user to **add another sql query** to origional query to make some sql operation to **retrative data** like this:

```ruby
9999 UNION ALL SELECT cc_num FROM CreditCards WHERE user_id=1
```

---

**- Blind SQL injection:**
Does not reflect the results of the injection on the output. In this case, the penetration tester must find an inference method to exploit the vulnerability

**- Blind Boolean Based SQLI**
Currently, most production websites do not display such errors.
This happens both because of the usability of the application; it is useless to display errors to end users who cannot understand or fix them, and a to achieve security through obscurity.

IF SQL Statement is **TRUE**  ✅ 
    **Render page Well**
IF SQL Statement is **FALSE** ❌  
    **Rencer page Bad**

**- Blind Time Based SQLI**
Time is used to infer a TRUE condition from a FALSE condition.

This SQL syntax is used:
```ruby
%SQL condition% waitfor delay '0:0:5’
If condition true response will wait 5 seconds
```
---

## 🌀  What is the impact of a successful SQL injection attack?

A **successful** SQL injection attack can result in:

**unauthorized access to sensitive data such as**

1. **passwords**
2. **credit card details**
3. **personal user information.**

Many high-profile data breaches in recent years have been the result of SQL injection attacks, leading to reputational damage and regulatory fines. In **some cases**, an attacker can obtain a **persistent backdoor** into an organization's systems, leading to a long-term compromise that can go unnoticed for an extended period.

## SQL injection examples

- [Retrieving hidden data](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection#retrieving-hidden-data), where you can modify an SQL query to return additional results.

- [Subverting application logic](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection#subverting-application-logic), where you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic.

- [UNION attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks), where you can retrieve data from different database tables.

- [Examining the database](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/examining-the-database), where you can extract information about the version and structure of the database.

- [Blind SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/blind), where the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses.

## 🐍 SQLMAP

**sqlmap** is an open source penetration testing tool developed by Bernardo Damele Assumpcao Guimaraes and Miroslav Stampar that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over database servers.
It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester, and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, fetching data from the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.

you can automate find many sqli with **SQLMAP**
