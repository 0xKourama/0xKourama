## ðŸ“š What Is HTML Injection ?

**HTML injection**  is an attack that is similar to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). While in the XSS vulnerability the attacker can inject and execute Javascript code, the HTML injection attack only allows the injection of certain HTML tags.

**HTML injection** is a type of **injection vulnerability** that occurs when a user is able to control an input point and is able to inject arbitrary **HTML code** into a vulnerable web page.

## ðŸ¤” Why HTML Injection Happen ?

**This vulnerability occurs** when user **input is not correctly sanitized** and the **output is not encoded.**

For example, malicious HTML code can be injected via the **`innerHTML`** JavaScript method, usually used to render user-inserted HTML code.

If strings are not correctly sanitized, the method can enable HTML injection. A JavaScript function that can be used for this purpose is **`document.write()`**.

---

## âš” Impact

1. It can allow an attacker to **modify** the page.
3. To **steal** another personâ€™s **identity**.
4. The attacker discovers injection vulnerability and decides to use an HTML injection attack. 
5. Attacker **crafts malicious links**, including his **injected HTML content**, and sends it to a user **via email**. 
6. **The attackerâ€™s injected HTML** is rendered and presented to the user **asking for a username and password.** 
7. **The user enters a username and password**, which are both **sent to the attackerâ€™s server**.

## ðŸ”Ž How To Find

Like XSS and DOM-Based XSS **check** every endpoint or paramteter that **accept your html tags** or **source code functions that render Html Content**
